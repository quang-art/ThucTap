### Create Amazon S3 Buckets

In this section, we will create 2 S3 Buckets for the project: one Bucket as static hosting for the Frontend website, and another Bucket to store static resources (Assets) such as match images and e-tickets uploaded by the Backend.

---

#### 1. Create Amazon S3 Bucket for Frontend

The S3 Bucket will block all public access entirely. Only the CloudFront Distribution will have read access to this Bucket.

1. Open the [Amazon S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#).
2. Click **Create bucket**.

3. In the **Create bucket** configuration interface:
   * **Bucket name**: Enter a globally unique name following this format: ```frontend-ticket-app-app-<your-account-id>``` (e.g., `frontend-ticket-app-app-123456789012`).
   * **AWS Region**: Select ```us-east-1``` (or the region you are using for the lab).
   * **Object Ownership**: Select **ACLs disabled (recommended)**.
   * **Block Public Access settings for this bucket**:
     * Check **Block all public access** (Completely block direct access from the internet).

#### 2. Create Amazon S3 Bucket for Assets (Images & E-tickets)

{{% notice info %}}
In addition to the Frontend Bucket, the application needs a separate S3 Bucket to store match images, e-tickets, and other assets uploaded by the Backend. This bucket allows public access to display images on the frontend interface.

3. Click **Create bucket** at the bottom of the page.
4. After the bucket is created, go to the bucket details page → select the **Permissions** tab → scroll to **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** → click **Edit** → paste the following CORS configuration:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST"],
       "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
       "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
     }
   ]
   ```
5. Click **Save changes**.
